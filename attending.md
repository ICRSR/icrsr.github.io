## Travel and Accommodation

Setúbal is part of the Lisbon Metropolitan Area and benefits from excellent transport connections by road, rail, and sea/river. [Driving](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xraAUFkh67go7bwU6) from Lisbon International Airport takes around 40 minutes, and there are several public transport options—such as bus and train services—to reach Setúbal.

Additionally, you can reach the Polytechnic Institute of Setúbal (IPS) from Setúbal’s main public transport hub (*Interface de Transportes de Setúbal*) by [bus](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZyFmRK9xQbGcdnDp6) or [train](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fVdyZ9VMggVYEKi7A). By car, the drive takes between 10 and 15 minutes.

Besides regular taxis, you can also use popular ridesharing services such as [Uber](https://www.uber.com/) and [Bolt](https://bolt.eu/).

### Traveling from Lisbon Airport to Setúbal by Public Transport
There are several options to travel from **Lisbon Airport** to **Setúbal**. You can purchase a pre-paid **Navengante** card and load it with balance, which can be used on any public transport operator in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area. Contactless payments are also available on **Fertagus** trains, the **Lisbon Metro** (subway), and **Carris** buses. **Please note** that **Carris** and **Carris Metropolitana** are not the same operator.

#### Option 1 (Metro from Airport + Bus to Setúbal)
Take the **Metro** (red line) from the airport to the **Oriente** station, then board the **Carris Metropolitana** bus [**4720**](https://www.carrismetropolitana.pt/lines/4720?active_pattern_id=4720_0_1) to Setúbal.

#### Option 2 (Metro from Airport + Train to Setúbal or an Alternative Bus)
Take the **Metro** (red line) from the airport to one of the stations in Lisbon where **Fertagus** trains stop and that are connected to the metro network:

- **Entrecampos**: Served by the **yellow line**.
- **Sete Rios**: The **Jardim Zoológico** metro station connects to the train station. If you arrive at **Sete Rios**, you can also take the [4725](https://www.carrismetropolitana.pt/lines/4725?active_pattern_id=4725_0_1) bus to Setúbal.
- **Roma-Areeiro**: Both **Roma** and **Areeiro** metro stations (on the **green line**) are near the train station.
- **Campolide**: This is the last **Fertagus** station in Lisbon before the train crosses the **25 de Abril Bridge** toward the south bank of the Tagus River. Note that there is no metro station near Campolide, so you may need to reach it by other means.

*NOTE*: These stations may also be accessible by other modes of transport, such as [Carris](https://www.carris.pt/en/travel/carreiras/) buses.
