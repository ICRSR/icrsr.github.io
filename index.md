Speakers will engage in a discourse regarding new methods to mitigate emerging risks, ensure long-term viability, and stimulate tourism in challenging regions.
 
**Discussion Topics**: Resilience strategies employed in events to address environmental and social challenges; the positive effects that environmentally responsible event planning can have on tourist destinations; case studies of tourist destinations where the integration of sustainability and resilience into events has been executed successfully; stakeholders’ partnerships to promote resilience and sustainability in tourism destinations.
 
**Round table participants**: Francisco Silva (Adjunct Professor at the “ESHTE - Escola Superior de Hotelaria e Turismo do Estoril”, specialist in regional and urban planning, and tourism and leisure), Susana Gonçalves (Adjunct Professor at the “ESHTE - Escola Superior de Hotelaria e Turismo do Estoril”, specialist in tourism and events) and Cláudia Caetano (President of the Tourist Entertainment section of “APECATE – Portuguese Association of Congress, Tourist Entertainment and Events Companies”).
