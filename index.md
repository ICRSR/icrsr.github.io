## Special Sessions

<section id="specialsession" markdown="1">

### Collaborative Innovation and Digital Co-creation for Sustainable Tourism Futures
The transformation of the tourism industry in the face of climate change, digitalization, and shifting societal values requires new paradigms of governance, strategic thinking, and stakeholder coordination. At the core of these challenges lies the imperative for more effective and forward‐looking tourism management. This special session, anchored in the **SHIFT** research project (Sustainability-oriented, Highly interactive, and Innovation-based Framework for Tourism Marketing), highlights how management practices can integrate collaboration, technology, and co‐creation to foster sustainable and resilient tourism ecosystems.

Tourism management must evolve from traditional models towards approaches that embrace systemic complexity, participatory governance, and cross-sector innovation. The papers included in this session address precisely this need by examining the design and implementation of collaborative marketing strategies, stakeholder engagement through co‐creation platforms, and scenario planning as a strategic management tool. In doing so, they provide critical insights into how destination management organizations, policy makers, and tourism enterprises can anticipate global trends and co‐develop inclusive and adaptive responses.

In a context marked by environmental, technological, and social transitions, this session—composed of five presentations (the first introducing the project and the remaining four presenting its core results)—is highly relevant for scholars and practitioners seeking to reimagine tourism management as a discipline that not only responds to change but actively shapes sustainable futures through innovation, interactivity, and stakeholder synergy.

### Value Creation in the Socio-Bioeconomy in the Amazon Region: Integrating Tradition, Innovation and Environmental Services
This session aims to provide experiences and knowledge exchange on value creation for businesses of traditional peoples and communities (TPCs), usually cooperatives, through the sustainable exploration of the socio-bioeconomy in the Amazon region. TPCs are keepers of traditional knowledge and practices and should be valued not only as guardians of the forest but also as disseminators of knowledge that can help mitigate climate change and environmental destruction. In this context, we propose to discuss factors that not only add value to their community businesses but also ensure that this value remains within the territory. To achieve this, we will address three key issues:
- Alliances for innovation
- Payment for environmental services  
- Sustainable productive chains

### Resilience and Sustainability in Events: Innovative Approaches for Tourist Destinations

***Room C1.13***

**Round Table Description**: Event tourism is an essential contributor to the economic development and promotion of international tourist destinations. However, events frequently find obstacles resulting from economic, social, and environmental factors. The primary objective of this roundtable discussion is to explore the ways in which events can incorporate sustainability and resilience principles, thereby fostering the development of dynamic and resilient tourism destinations. Speakers will engage in a discourse regarding new methods to mitigate emerging risks, ensure long-term viability, and stimulate tourism in challenging regions.
 
**Discussion Topics**: Resilience strategies employed in events to address environmental and social challenges; the positive effects that environmentally responsible event planning can have on tourist destinations; case studies of tourist destinations where the integration of sustainability and resilience into events has been executed successfully; stakeholders’ partnerships to promote resilience and sustainability in tourism destinations.
 
**Round table participants**: Francisco Silva (Adjunct Professor at the “ESHTE - Escola Superior de Hotelaria e Turismo do Estoril”, specialist in regional and urban planning, and tourism and leisure), Susana Gonçalves (Adjunct Professor at the “ESHTE - Escola Superior de Hotelaria e Turismo do Estoril”, specialist in tourism and events) and Cláudia Caetano (President of the Tourist Entertainment section of “APECATE – Portuguese Association of Congress, Tourist Entertainment and Events Companies”).
 
**Moderator**: Filipe Segurado Severino (Post-Doctoral Fellow of the SHIFT project; Invited Adjunct Professor at “ESHTE - Escola Superior de Hotelaria e Turismo do Estoril”, specialist in tourism and events)
